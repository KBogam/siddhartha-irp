          The story of <em>Siddhartha</em> takes place in ancient India, during the time
          of the Buddha. The world is full of forests, rivers, villages, and cities. Siddhartha
          travels through many different places, each representing a different stage of life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Early in the story, Siddhartha lives in his father’s home in a peaceful town. He
          then leaves to live as a Samana, wandering through forests and practicing strict
          self-discipline. Later, he experiences life in the city, filled with wealth, luxury,
          and human desires.
        </p>

        <p>
          The river near the end of the story is a key setting, symbolizing life, time, and
          wisdom. It is there that Siddhartha finally understands the unity of all experiences
          and reaches inner peace. The different settings reflect both the external and inner
          journey Siddhartha undertakes.
